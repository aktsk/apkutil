`apkutil` is a useful utility for mobile security testing.
This tool makes it easy to resign the APK, check for potentially sensitive files and `AndroidManifest.xml` in the APK.

It is a wrapper for `apktool`, `apksigner`, `aapt`, and `zipalign` commands.

iOS version is [here](https://github.com/sterrasec/ipautil).

## Requirements

- Android SDK build tools
  - Set PATH to `ANDROID_HOME` for `apksigner`, `aapt`, and `zipalign`.
- [Apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)

Also, place `~/apkutil.json` containing the keystore information necessary for signing apk in your home directory.

```
{
    "keystore_path": "hoge.keystore",
    "ks-key-alias": "fuga",
    "ks-pass": "pass:foo"
}
```

The certificate used for signing can be created using keytool.

```
$ keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore hoge.keystore -alias fuga -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 
```

## Installation

Since `apkutil` is implemented in Python, it can be installed with the pip command, which is a Python package management system.

```
$ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/sterrasec/apkutil.git
```

## Usage

The command outputs are displayed in color. You can use a function with subcommands.
The GIF shows the scene where the APK is changed to debuggable and `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` is created.

### Subcommands

Most of the subcommands are assigned with alias, which is useful.

| subcommand   | alias         | desc                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all`        | -             | set debuggable & networkSecurityConfig, build & sign APK |
| `debuggable` | `debug`, `dg` | set debuggable, build & sign APK                         |
| `network`    | `net`, `n`    | set networkSecurityConfig, build & sign APK              |
| `info`       | `i`           | identify the package name                                |
| `screenshot` | `ss`          | get screenshot from connected device                     |
| `decode`     | `d`           | decode APK                                               |
| `build`      | `b`           | build APK                                                |
| `sign`       | `s`           | sign APK                                                 |
| `align`      | `a`           | align APK                                                |
| `pull`       | `p`           | pull APKs from device                                    |

### Apply all necessary patches for pentest

`all` subcommand sets networkSecurityConfig, makes the APK debuggable.
Decode the APK, set debuggable attribute to `true`, set networkSecurityConfig attribute to `@xml/network_security_config` in AndroidManifest, make `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`, and rebuild it.

This feature is useful to make APK accept user certs, and use [sterrasec/apk-medit](https://github.com/sterrasec/apk-medit).

```
$ apkutil all sample.apk

### Set up networkSecurityConfig

`network` subcommand sets networkSecurityConfig.
Decode the APK, set networkSecurityConfig attribute to `@xml/network_security_config` in AndroidManifest, make `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`, and rebuild it.

This feature is useful to make APK accept user certs.

```
$ apkutil network sample.apk
...

Output: sample.patched.apk
```

### Set debuggable attribute

`debuggable` subcommand makes the APK debuggable.
Decode the APK, set debuggable attribute to `true` in AndroidManifest, and rebuild it.

This feature is useful to use [sterrasec/apk-medit](https://github.com/sterrasec/apk-medit).

```
$ apkutil debuggable sample.apk
...

Output: sample.patched.apk
```

### Get the package name

`info` subcommand allows you to see the package name.

```
$ apkutil info sample.apk

    A: package="jp.sterrasec.sample" (Raw: "jp.sterrasec.sample")
```

### Get the screenshot

`screenshot` subcommand allows you to get the screenshot from connected device.

```
$ apkutil screenshot

/data/local/tmp/screenshot-2020-05-21-16-58-20.png: 1 file pulled. 2.1 MB/s (14419 bytes in 0.007s)

Output: screenshot-2020-05-21-16-58-20.png
```

### Decode the APK

`decode` subcommand make the APK decode by apktool.
When decoding the APK, check for potentially sensitive files and check the AndroidManifest.xml.

```

...

Potentially Sensitive Files:
sample/README.md
sample/hoge.sh

Checking AndroidManifest.xml...
Permission:
android.permission.INTERNET

None
```
